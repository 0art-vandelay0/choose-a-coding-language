        <h1>Choosing a Coding Language</h1>
        <p>Check which statement is most important to you when choosing a language:</p>
        <div class="form">
            <div class="form-entry" id="languageSurvery">
                <input id="q1" type="radio" name="language" value="python">
                <label for="q1">I care about concise, easily readable, and straightforward syntax.</label>
                <br>
                <input id="q2" type="radio" name="language" value="javascript">
                <label for="q2">I am most concerned with Cross-Platform Compatibility.</label>
                <br>
                <input id="q3" type="radio" name="language" value="rust">
                <label for="q3">I care about a faster performance with low memory footprint.</label>
                <br>
                <input id="q4" type="radio" name="language" value="javascript">
                <label for="q4">I want to focus more on the front-end of web devopment.</label>
                <br>
                <input id="q5" type="radio" name="language" value="python">
                <label for="q5">I am interested in getting into data analysis and machine learning.</label>
                <br>
                <button id="subButton" type="submit">Submit</button>
                </form>
            </div>
            <div id="responseContainer" class="choice-response">
                <div id="python" class="hidden">
                    <p class="bold">You should try <span class="uppercase">Python!</span></p>
                    <p>Python is more readable than most languages because it uses a simplified syntax with clear and
                        intuitive keywords and structures, making it easier to understand and follow even for those new
                        to
                        coding.</p>
                    <p>Python has extensive community support and a rapidly growing popularity among developers, making
                        it highly sought after in the job market for its wide range of applications, from web
                        development and data analysis to machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Python is a great language for database managment and back-end web development with frameworks
                        like
                        Flask and Django.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="javaScript" class="hidden">
                    <p class="bold">You should try <span class="uppercase">Javascript!</span></p>
                    <p>JavScript provides powerful built-in tools for manipulating the webpage DOM, making it a great
                        front-end web development language. It is also natively supported by browsers.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is a versitle language and offers excellent cross-platform compatibility, allowing
                        developers to write code once and run it seamlessly across different operating systems and
                        devices, including desktops, mobile devices, and even embedded systems.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript's widespread adoption and support makes it the de facto language for web development,
                        with an extensive ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools available.</p>
